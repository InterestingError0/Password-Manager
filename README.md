# Password-Manager
A password manager I made using C++.
## Features
* Storing passwords and notes and organizing them into folders.
* Adding and removing folders.
* Master password hashed using Scrypt and a randomly generated salt.
* Generating random passwords where the user can select the length, and whether symbols, numbers, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters are included.
